\title{Check scientific names and sampled species in the Fish Tree of Life}
\usage{
check_fish_names_FTOL(names, rank = "Species", sampled = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{names}{A string or character vector of names}

\item{rank}{A string; the taxonomic rank at which names should be checked.
Must be one of "Species" (default), "Genus", "Family",
"Order", or "Class"}

\item{sampled}{Logical, only if \code{rank = "Species"}.
If names have to be checked for unsampled species
(i.e. those without genetic data,
see Rabosky et al. 2018 for detailed methodology)}
}
\value{
A message. If any non-valid name is found, a data frame is also returned
invisibly, including non-valid supplied names and suggested names.
If \code{rank = "Species"} and \code{sampled = TRUE}, and any non-valid name
or unsampled species is found, a list is returned invisibly with the
following two elements:
\itemize{
\item \code{name_error}: data frame with non valid supplied names and suggested names
\item \code{not_sampled}: vector of supplied names without genetic data
}
}
